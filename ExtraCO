Dear ICAN Member,

Greetings from India. My name is Jai, and I work as a Cloud Engineer II at Verizon in Chennai. I recently had the opportunity to experience Project Witness, and it deeply moved me.

Through the immersive stories, I gained a profound understanding of the hardships you faced as a child in the criminal legal system and the incredible strength you’ve shown throughout your journey. Your resilience and ability to overcome such tremendous challenges are truly inspiring.

I want to extend my heartfelt support and encouragement as you navigate the world outside of prison. I can only imagine how daunting it must be to adapt to the rapid advancements in technology and the many changes that occurred during your time away. Please know that your efforts to reintegrate and pursue your goals are admired and supported by people like me, even from across the globe.

Your story and the stories of others like you highlight the urgent need for a society that respects and nurtures every child’s potential for change and growth. Your journey is a testament to the power of human resilience and the capacity for transformation.

As you continue to build your future, I hope you find joy in discovering new opportunities and experiences. Embrace the learning curve, knowing that it is never too late to aim high and achieve your dreams. Your unique perspective and experiences are invaluable, and I believe they will lead you to success in whatever path you choose.

Please remember that you have a community of supporters who believe in you and your potential. Stay strong, stay motivated, and keep aiming high. Your courage and perseverance are a beacon of hope and inspiration to us all.

With deep respect and admiration,

Jai
