Nationally, Hope For The Warriors provides comprehensive support programs for service members, veterans, and military families that are focused on transition, health and wellness, peer engagement, and connections to community resources.

Hope For The Warriors is a family, united by our shared conviction of honor and sacrifice.

One way Hope For The Warriors touches those associated with the military is by sending "Thank You" or "Thinking of You" cards.

How You Can Help
Write a "thank you" or "thinking of you" cards to our veterans.  It's important to let them know someone is thinking of them and they are not alone.  HOPE will then deliver the cards to our deserving veterans.

You are encouraged to get your creative 'hat' on and pull out your craft supplies. Make a card or write in a blank card to express your appreciation or to just remind a veteran that someone is thinking of them.
