I am going to have a review today where I will be showcasing the milestones which has been acheived. In this as pect I will be covering "Platform engineering - SRE" so please give me bullet points to concentrate so that I can make my presentaion so confident and interactive. Below are the fators to concentrate - 
"SRE Unified Observability platform all E&I platforms. Some of the Key features of SRE V2 dashboard are
- Summarized view of Availability & Reliability for all platforms
- Simplified Infrastructure Lifecycle Management Framework to measure Reliability
- 2 Level Executive views & 2+ level for admins with drill down to raw events
- Easy navigation between platforms and metrics
- Able to spot the changes easily using color indicators & % change metrics
- Provides first hand information to admins & reduces admin effort to analyze the issue

Also give me the differnce between the normal mointroing system and a Dashboard or a system which is build on top of SRE bestpratices which will be more helpful

And end with the agenda saying that, The goal is to build a Dashbaord which will be provding the first hand information to the admins of respective platfroms to divedeep into any unextpected outages or anolomiles. Also we are tragetting to develop a dimension where we will be prividing the suggestions and actions needed to be taken for a event or a metric so that the will ensure the relaibiliy of Platform teams.
