Certainly! Here's a note of gratitude to a crisis counselor:

Dear Trevor Project Crisis Counselor,

Thank you for joining our recent Verizon Ally Training workshop and for your ongoing dedication as a crisis counselor. Your commitment to supporting LGBTQ+ young people is truly inspiring and vital. 

Your empathetic and unwavering support offers a lifeline to those who may feel alone or hopeless. Knowing that one accepting adult can decrease the risk of suicide by 40% highlights the immense impact of your work. By being that supportive adult, you are saving lives and fostering hope.

Through the training, I learned so much about the importance of allyship, pronouns, and the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ youth. This understanding deepens my appreciation for the critical role you play in their lives. Your ability to provide comfort and understanding during crisis moments is nothing short of heroic.

Please know that your efforts are profoundly valued and that you are making a significant difference in the lives of many. Thank you for your compassion, dedication, and the lifesaving work you do every day.

With heartfelt appreciation,

Jai
