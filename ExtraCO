Subject: A Dynamic Blend of Tech, Talent, and Tenacity

Dear [Recipient's Name],

Greetings from India!

I am Jai Sai Deep, and I’m thrilled to be part of this voluntary program. As a B.Tech graduate in Mechanical Engineering from SASTRA University (class of 2022), I am currently channeling my passion for technology as a Cloud Engineer II at Verizon.

Beyond my professional life, I am a fervent explorer of various interests. I find joy in cooking, capturing moments through mobile photography, dancing, delving into AI advancements, and indulging in Marvel movies. 

Born in 2001, I have always embraced challenges and leadership roles, notably serving as Captain of the 26 Andhra Pradesh Battalion in NCC, an experience that honed my skills in teamwork and resilience.

I apologize for the delay in this introduction. I faced technical issues logging into the EQUALS portal, which have now been resolved. Prioritizing our connection, I’m sending this email as soon as possible.

To stay connected and learn more about me, you can find me on Instagram [Instagram ID] and LinkedIn [LinkedIn Profile].

As we embark on this journey together, I leave you with a thought: "Innovation is not just about ideas; it’s about making ideas happen."

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Warm regards,

Jai Sai Deep
