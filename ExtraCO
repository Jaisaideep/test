Support ICAN members through Project Witness
Learn about Project Witness and help create a digital mural of support for Incarcerated Children’s Advocacy Network (ICAN) members.

Overview
The CFSY envisions the United States becoming a society that respects all children’s human rights and nurtures their capacity to become leaders, responding to any harm they cause in ways that are rooted in their dignity and unique potential for change. We seek a response to harm caused by children that is conscientious of childhood traumas, restorative and empowering to all parties, and equitable, especially with regard to race and ethnicity. 

Project Witness is designed to build awareness of the experience of children in the criminal legal system and solitary confinement in the United States. Project Witness features the stories of six individuals who were each incarcerated as children and who collectively spent almost 90 years in prison. It depicts the policies and practices that result in inhumane conditions for incarcerated children, particularly children of color, in the United States. Viewers engaging with Project Witness will see the experience of prison through the eyes of a child and hear first-hand accounts from formerly incarcerated children – their personal encounters, memories, feelings, fears, and hopes. Incorporated in Project Witness are original artwork, poetry, and spoken word created by these same individuals. Project Witness was created through a partnership between the CFSY, YouTube, and Google using immersive virtual reality and Google Lens technologies. 

How You Can Help
During this event you will experience first-hand what it’s like for a youth in prison by watching Project Witness. Using the sentiments of that experience, you will follow a letter-writing guide to create a meaningful and impactful letter to an Incarcerated Children’s Advocacy Network (ICAN) member, all of who were given an extreme sentence and imprisoned as children. Raise awareness and show support through this event.

Because all ICAN members were incarcerated as children and spent decades behind bars, they face challenges unique to this population of formerly incarcerated individuals. Locked away as children, they were not given the opportunity to learn about and experience the world as adults, meaning that aspects of life we often take for granted may take ICAN members time to adjust to. These challenges may include new technology that developed while they were incarcerated, including computers, email, and cell phones. This is especially challenging due to this technology's essential nature to everyday work and life. As ICAN members integrate into free society and create pathways for prosperity and wellbeing, these letters will help encourage them to aim high in their work aspirations and give them confidence towards career success.
