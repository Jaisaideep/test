Dear ICAN Member,

Greetings from India! My name is Jai, and I work as a Cloud Engineer II at Verizon in Chennai. I recently had the opportunity to experience Project Witness, and I was deeply moved by the powerful stories and the immense resilience demonstrated by those who were incarcerated as children.

Your journey and strength in the face of such immense challenges are truly inspiring. I want you to know that your courage and perseverance have not gone unnoticed. Your story is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity and to find hope and strength even in the darkest of times.

As you navigate your new path in a world that has changed so much, please remember that there are people who believe in you and support you. Adapting to new technologies and the fast pace of today's world may seem daunting, but with your resilience and determination, I am confident you will overcome these challenges and thrive.

Your experiences and the insights you bring are invaluable. They offer a unique perspective that can drive meaningful change and inspire others. As you work towards your goals and aspirations, know that you have a community that stands with you, cheering you on every step of the way.

Thank you for sharing your story through Project Witness. It has opened my eyes to the importance of understanding and compassion in our justice system. Your bravery helps pave the way for a more just and humane society.

Stay strong, aim high, and never lose sight of the incredible potential within you. Your journey matters, and you are making a difference.

With heartfelt support and admiration,

Jai
