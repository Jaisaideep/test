Overview
Allies save lives: We know that having one accepting adult in their life can decrease an LGBTQ+ young person’s risk of suicide by 40%. Fostering authentic allyship is core to our mission as we work to ensure no young LGBTQ+ person ever feels alone or hopeless.


There is no one way to be an LGBTQ+ ally, but there are best practices. Trevor’s approach to LGBTQ+ allyship is informed by our expertise in suicide prevention and identifies the real-life mental health challenges youth face when they lack affirming support systems. In providing education, facilitating group dialogue, and sharing real-life tools, our Ally Training is designed to increase understanding and action-oriented allyship that promote positive mental health outcomes for all LGBTQ+ young people.

 

This asychronous training opportunity allows you to watch a recording of the 2023 Verizon Ally Training workshop. Ally Training brings to the forefront the importance of diverse and inclusive workplaces while empowering attendees to ask questions without fear of judgment. You will learn what it means to be an authentic ally of LGBTQ+ people, learn the latest terminology used to describe LGBTQ+ communities, explore the ins and outs of “coming out”, learn about the importance of pronouns, and discuss the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ youth and adults in their homes, schools, workplaces, and communities. 

How You Can Help
Every single one of us has the power to be that one supportive adult for the LGBTQ+ youth we know, so we invite you to spend time gaining valuable skills to be that person for the LGBTQ+ youth in your life. You'll also learn more about The Trevor Project's urgent mission and how our programs are supporting LGBTQ+ youth in crisis. You'll receive resources to learn how to show up for the LGBTQ+ youth in their communities.

 

To create an impact with your learning, volunteers will also write a letter to a crisis counselor. Your letter should be compassionate and encouraging.

Write a note of gratitude to a Crisis Counselor at this link. Volunteer credit is only granted when the letter is complete. Volunteer credit is not earned without this component.
