Week 2 - Goals & Dreams
×
Week 2 focuses on goals and dreams! It’s the perfect opportunity for you to share with your mentor/mentee some of your goals and dreams, be they professional or personal. 

Dear Mentor,
As you will see in the full programme syllabus, week 2 will focus on goals and dreams.
It’s the perfect opportunity for you to share with your mentee some of your goals and
dreams, be they professional or personal, and perhaps how you worked/are working
towards them. By sharing strategies that you have found useful to accomplish your
goals, your mentee will find it easier to visualize her own goals and find ways to achieve
them. Please do feel free to ask your mentee about her dreams and goals and share
any advice you deem relevant to the subject. For more details about this week’s
session, please don't hesitate to refer to week 2 of the full programme syllabus on
your dashboard, where you’ll find some sample questions, tips and other resources.
Then send your email via your inbox to your mentee.
Our team is committed to guiding you throughout the e-mentoring programme. Please
don’t hesitate to contact us, if you have any questions.
We wish you a great week!
The Her Digital Skills e-Mentoring Team
