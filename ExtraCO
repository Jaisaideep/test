now let us do this for ML platform
Give me python code for generating synthetic data by making use of pandas and numpys by storing them in DataFrames and utlimately we need to store them CSV file. The schema of the table will be 
"Logdate":
6/3/24 to 6/10/24)
"Platform":ML
"Application/Category": Domino GCP, Domino On-Prem, Datarobot GCP, Vertex AI 
"Experience%": Float value which can have range between 90 to 100
"Performance%": Float value which can have range between 90 to 100
"Compliance%": Float value which can have range between 90 to 100 
Note: The data is needed to be generated for each Service on each day. Hope you understand the logic

"SLI %":
Float value which can have range between 90 to 100
Note: 
1.The data is needed to be generated for each application for each ILM Stage on Each respective SLI Metric on each day. Hope you understand the logic
2. For metrics in Experiance and Compilance, change the non comparative metrics to compartive to be more precise eg: "Domino Workspace SpinUp Time" can be convreted as "Domino Workspace SpinUp Time < 2 Min". So please consider to change all non comparitive SLI Metrics to Comparative metrics as per industry standards so that we will have a clear SLI
3. By understading the metrics for Domino GCP, Domino On-Prem, Data Robot. brainstrom your self and give me 7 SLI metrics for Experience, 6 SLI metrics for Performance and 4 SLI metrics for Compliance  respectively for Vertex AI applicaiton of ILM stage and make sure Experiance and Perfroamnce are comparative metrics
