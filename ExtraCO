now let us do this for ML platform
Give me python code for generating synthetic data by making use of pandas and numpys by storing them in DataFrames and utlimately we need to store them CSV file. The schema of the table will be 
"Logdate":
6/3/24 to 6/10/24)
"Platform":ML
"Application/Category": 
Domino GCP, Domino On-Prem,Datarobot GCP,Vertex AI
"Services":
Domino GCP - Domino, GKE Cluster, Mongo DB, One Artifactory
Domino On-Prem - Domino, GKE Cluster, Mongo DB, One Artifactory
Datarobot GCP - DataRobot,  GKE Cluster, Mongo DB, One Artifactory
Vertex AI - Vertex AI, GKE Cluster, Mongo DB, One Artifactory
"Availability%": Float value which can have range between 85 to 100

Note: The data is needed to be generated for each Service on each day. Hope you understand the logic


Give me a Business Case reason justification for selecting a team member for Cheers for Peers!
She is from OPSEXC team, where she is very good at Jira and Incident manegments and tracking of them and finding the rootcause and the approch she attempts for analysis.

Note: When you submit the business case(s), ensure to avoid names, instead use only pronouns - He/Him/His or She/Her/Her or They/Them/Their.
Also ensure to write your business case as elaborately as possible substantiating with details and tangible results, that makes it more impactful when getting evaluated by our panelists.
