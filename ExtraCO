Overview
Write letters of gratitude all year to employees of the U.S. Forest Service...and sponsor trees to be planted in National Forests!

The National Forest Foundation (NFF) works on behalf of the American public to inspire personal and meaningful connections to our National Forests. By directly engaging communities and leveraging private and public funding, the NFF leads forest conservation efforts and promotes responsible recreation. Each year the NFF restores fish and wildlife habitats, facilitates common ground, plants trees in areas affected by fire, insects, and disease, and improves recreational opportunities. The NFF believes our National Forests and all they offer are a treasure and vital to the health of our communities. 

Working with the U.S. Forest Service and partners, our goal is to leverage our best thinking, conservation capacity, and community action to measurably improve the health of our National Forests and Grasslands.
