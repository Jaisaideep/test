now let us do this for ML platform
Give me python code for generating synthetic data by making use of pandas and numpys by storing them in DataFrames and utlimately we need to store them CSV file. The schema of the table will be 
"Logdate":
6/3/24 to 6/10/24)
"Platform":ML
"Application/Category": 
Domino GCP, Domino On-Prem,Datarobot GCP,Vertex AI
"Services":
Domino GCP - Domino, GKE Cluster, Mongo DB, One Artifactory
Domino On-Prem - Domino, GKE Cluster, Mongo DB, One Artifactory
Datarobot GCP - DataRobot,  GKE Cluster, Mongo DB, One Artifactory
Vertex AI - Vertex AI, GKE Cluster, Mongo DB, One Artifactory
"Availability%": Float value which can have range between 85 to 100

Note: The data is needed to be generated for each Service on each day. Hope you understand the logic
