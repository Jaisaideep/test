### Key Points for Presentation on "Platform Engineering - SRE"

#### SRE Unified Observability Platform - Key Features of SRE V2 Dashboard

1. **Summarized View of Availability & Reliability**
   - Provides an aggregated view of availability and reliability metrics across all platforms.
   - Helps in quick assessment of the overall health of the infrastructure.

2. **Simplified Infrastructure Lifecycle Management Framework**
   - Measures reliability through a structured framework.
   - Ensures consistency and accuracy in reliability metrics.

3. **Executive and Admin Views**
   - **2 Level Executive Views**: High-level summary for executives to understand platform status at a glance.
   - **2+ Level Admin Views**: Detailed views for admins with drill-down capabilities to raw events.
   - Enables efficient monitoring and management from both strategic and operational perspectives.

4. **Easy Navigation**
   - Intuitive interface for seamless navigation between different platforms and metrics.
   - Enhances user experience and reduces time spent on finding specific information.

5. **Change Detection and Visualization**
   - Color indicators and percentage change metrics to highlight significant changes.
   - Facilitates quick identification of issues or deviations.

6. **First-hand Information for Admins**
   - Provides real-time data to admins, reducing the time and effort needed to analyze issues.
   - Enhances proactive management and response to potential problems.

### Difference Between Normal Monitoring Systems and SRE-based Dashboards

- **Normal Monitoring Systems**:
  - Typically provide raw data and basic alerts.
  - Focus on individual metrics without comprehensive context.
  - Limited in terms of advanced analytics and proactive insights.

- **SRE-based Dashboards**:
  - Integrate best practices from Site Reliability Engineering.
  - Offer comprehensive views combining multiple metrics for holistic understanding.
  - Include advanced features like automated incident response, reliability scoring, and predictive analytics.
  - Designed to improve reliability, reduce downtime, and enhance overall platform performance.

### Closing Agenda

**Goal:**
To build a Dashboard providing first-hand information to the admins of respective platforms, enabling them to deep-dive into any unexpected outages or anomalies. Our target is to develop a dimension offering suggestions and actions needed for specific events or metrics, ensuring the reliability of platform teams.

This approach will not only enhance the efficiency of our monitoring systems but also empower our teams to maintain high standards of reliability and performance across all platforms.
