Give me python code for generating synthetic data by making use of pandas and numpys by storing them in DataFrames and utlimately we need to store them CSV file. The schema of the table will be 
"Logdate":
6/3/24 to 6/10/24)
"Platform":GCP
"Application/Category": 
Storage, Compute, Data & Analytics, Database, Developer Tools
"Services":
Storage = GCS, Local SSD
Compute = Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, GCE, GKE
Data & Analytics = BigQuery, Composer, Dataflow, Dataproc, Pub/Sub, Data Catalog, Data Fusion
Database = BigTable, CloudSQL, Memory Store
Developer Tools = Artificat Registry, CloudBuild, Cloud Sheduler, Cloud SDK
"Availability%": Float value which can have range between 85 to 100

Note: The data is needed to be generated for each Service on each day. Hope you understand the logic
