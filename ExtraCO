now let us do this for ML platform
Give me python code for generating synthetic data by making use of pandas and numpys by storing them in DataFrames and utlimately we need to store them CSV file. The schema of the table will be 
"Logdate":
6/3/24 to 6/10/24)
"Platform":ML, BI Tools, Teradata, Hadoop, GCP, D&A
"ILM Stage Metric":Experience, Performance, Compliance
"ILM%": Float value which can have range between 90 to 100 
Note: The data is needed to be generated for each Platform on each day for every ILM Stage. Hope you understand the logic
